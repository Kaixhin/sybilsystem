===========

A MATLAB library for prototyping deep neural networks (that can be trained using backpropagation). Developed for automation, not speed. To get started run the initialize script.

This work has been based on the [Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) and utilises some of the helper functions provided.

This library utilises the [minFunc optimization package](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html) by Mark Schmidt (2012), with its own licensing terms.

**WISHLIST**

- Classification results
- Batch accuracy
- Convolution and pooling layers (only FC now)
- Exporting networks and layers
- Automatic saving during training
- Visualisation of learnt features
