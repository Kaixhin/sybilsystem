===========

A MATLAB library for prototyping deep neural networks (that can be trained using backpropagation), named for the eponymous "supercomputer".
Developed for clear code, not speed.
To get started run the initialize script.

This work has been based on the [Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) and utilises some of the helper functions provided.
