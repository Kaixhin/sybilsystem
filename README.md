sybilsystem
===========

A MATLAB library for prototyping deep neural networks (that can be trained using backpropagation).
So named for the predictive powers of the Cumaean Sybil and the eponymous supercomputer that utilises "neural networks".
Developed for clear code, not speed.
To get started run the initialize script.

This work has been based on the [Unsupervised Feature Learning and Deep Learning Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) and utilises some of the helper functions provided.
